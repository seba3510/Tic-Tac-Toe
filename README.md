# Tic-Tac-Toe

# Description

This project implements a game of "Tic-Tac-Toe". This project is part of
[The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [JavaScript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript). This game was built with the use of Factory Functions and the Module Pattern.

This game has the 2 buttons: One that starts the game, and another one that restarts the game. When the button that starts the game is clicked, a dialog box is displayed with a form that prompts both players to enter their names. When both players enter their names, the game begins. The button that restarts the game displays the dialog box once again, so the users can enter their names. After that, the "Restart Game" button is disabled to prevent the users from clicking it while they are in the middle of a match.

As recommended by the [project's instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe), I first made sure that the game worked in the console. This "Divide and Conquer" approach was really useful, because instead of focusing on the logic of the game, and how it worked with the DOM and HTML/CSS, I only focused on making sure that the logic of the game worked as expected.
